# Introduction
This repo created to show bug in auto instrumntation in .NET open telemetry.
We have two project A and B. the Both project use open telemtery tracing. project B use ASPNet core instrumentation. projectB call projectA . Project A enable ASPNet core and http client instrumentation.
The issue appear when projectB call project A, projectA span has invalid span parent id as in following image:
![enter image description here](https://github.com/OmniaSalehSaad/ProjectB/blob/master/Images/Screenshot%202022-08-24%20141620.png)
in the above image span of projectA should be child of span of projectB but the relationship doesn't appear correctly.
But when ProjectB using ASPNet core and http client instrumentation. the relationship  between spans appeared correctly.
